**Ex. 3.1** Show that the $F$ statistic (3.13) for dropping a single coeffcient from a model is equal to the square of the corresponding $z$-score (3.12).

**Proof**

Recall that equation 3.13 for $F$ statistic is:

$$
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{(RSS_0 - RSS_1) / (p_1 - p_0)}{RSS_1 / (N - p_1 - 1)}
\end{equation}
$$

And that the $F$ statistic will have a $F_{p_1 - p_0, N-p_1 - 1}$ distribution under the null hypothesis, of which the smaller model is correct, and the Gaussian assumptions.

By dropping a single coefficient from a model, here the $F$ statistic will have a $F_{1, N-p - 1}$ distribution where $p + 1$ are the number of parameters in the original model. 

Then recall that equation 3.12 for $z$-score is:

$$
\begin{equation}
z_j = \frac{\hat \beta_j}{\hat \sigma \sqrt{v_j}}
\end{equation}
$$

Under the null hypothesis that $\beta_j=0$, $z_j$ is distributed as $t_{N-p-1}$.

Since t-test is a specific case of F-test and we are testing identical hypotheses under identical distributions, we will have the same value in this case.
